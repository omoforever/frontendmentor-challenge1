# 🥚 Simple Omelette Recipe Page

A clean, responsive recipe webpage built as part of a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge. This project displays a classic omelette recipe using **plain HTML and CSS**, with no JavaScript or frameworks.

## 📄 Overview

This page includes:

- A featured image of the dish
- A recipe title and short description
- Preparation time summary
- Ingredients list
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
